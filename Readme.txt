Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier

Language Used: Python

Steps to compile the code:
1. Open any Python IDE or command prompt and open the file NaiveBayes.py
2. Run NaiveBayes.py
3. Download data and store in folders as Train and Test and copy the location.
4. After running the file enter the train folder path and test folderpath:
   Example: "F:/Train F:/Test"
5. The program would build the multinomial naive bayes classifier on train data and prints the accuracy of the classifier 
   on the test data.
