Team members: Adithya Ganapathy(axg172330) and Nisshanthni Divakaran(nxd171330)

Language Used: Python

Steps to compile the code:
1. Open any Python IDE or command prompt and open the file NaiveBayes.py
2. Run NaiveBayes.py
3. Place the folders Train and Test in a location and copy the path.
4. After running the file enter the train folder path and test folderpath:
   Example: "F:/20news-bydate-train F:/20news-bydate-test"
5. The program would build the multinomial naive bayes classifier on train data and prints the accuracy of the classifier 
   on the test data.
